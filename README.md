#**Mission-to-Mars**

This project included webscraping from different websites about Mars to create a website run by flask. BeatifulSoup and Splinter were used to parse the info from the websites.  Flask and mongodb were utilized for the new website of the mars information combined.

The app.py file was created to run the scraping.py file and index.html and project the scraped information on to flask using chrome webdriver.

The web page is mobile-responsive.  The additional bootstrap components are the hemisphere images are now placed 4 in a row instead of 2 on top and 2 on bottom.  The width of the page was changed to container-fluid to fill the whole screen.
